Node TS + React TS + LLM Agents | Full Stack Developer,S.A.G.A Corp,Remote,remote,2025-10-08,Indeed,"You're built for big things, not endless marketing tasks. At SAAGA Solve, our intelligent agents manage all the tricky parts of getting noticed on search and social media, so established businesses and growing startups can truly focus on what they do best - innovating, building, and serving their customers.
We’re hiring a senior full-stack engineer to help us build AI-powered products end-to-end. You’ll own features from rough idea to production: architecture, implementation, testing, release, and iteration. The work spans modern web (Node.js, React, Next.js, TypeScript) and LLM agents (tooling, function calling, integrations, evaluation, and reliability).
You’ll thrive here if you: (a) write clean, production-grade code fast, (b) treat tests and monitoring as part of “done,” (c) think like a founder—challenge assumptions, propose better paths, make decisions with incomplete data, and ship. We’re an A-player team; we expect proactive ownership, direct communication, and the courage to push back when something isn’t right.
What success looks like:
In first weeks days: ship a user-visible feature, add/extend an agent tool, and land solid PRs with strong tests.
In first Q days: lead a small project across front-end, back-end, and an LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini or Vercel AI SDK/OpenRouter), with metrics and basic evals.
Be a go-to owner for a product slice, raising code quality, performance, and reliability while mentoring others on agent patterns.
Requirements
12+ years professional software engineering experience delivering production systems.
Full-stack depth: Node.js, React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript at an expert level (types as design, not decoration).
AI/LLM agents: hands-on experience building agents with function/tool calling, multi-tool orchestration, retries, cost/latency trade-offs, and safety/guardrails. Comfortable with prompt design, schema design, and deterministic interfaces.
APIs & SDKs: strong with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini; plus nice to have one of Vercel AI SDK or OpenRouter. Able to design clean abstraction layers over external models/tools.
Systems & product thinking: convert fuzzy requirements into simple, resilient architectures. Bias to ship; know when to spike, when to harden.
Testing discipline: writes your own unit, integration, and happy-path/end-to-end tests; partners with QA for edge-cases and complex scenarios. “It works on my machine” is not done.
Quality in production: observability (logs/metrics/traces), feature flags, canary/rollbacks, performance profiling, and error budgets are familiar tools, not buzzwords.
Data & storage: practical experience with REST/GraphQL, Webhooks, background jobs/queues, caching, and at least one SQL database. Comfortable with pagination, idempotency, and rate-limit strategies.
Security & privacy: sound judgment around secrets, authZ/authN, PII handling, and least-privilege by default.
AI-assisted development: enthusiastic and effective using AI for coding/review/testing, while maintaining rigorous standards and architectural sense.
Collaboration: crisp written communication, clear PRs, structured RFCs, and constructive code reviews.
Founder mindset: proactive, decisive, comfortable with uncertainty. Preferred: familiarity with Y Combinator content/principles (default alive, talk to users, build/measure/learn).
Nice to have (not required): RAG pipelines, vector DBs, lightweight eval harnesses, prompt/version management, streaming UX, and cost telemetry.

Node TS + React TS + LLM Agents | Full Stack Developer,S.A.G.A Corp,Remote,remote,2025-10-08,Indeed,"You're built for big things, not endless marketing tasks. At SAAGA Solve, our intelligent agents manage all the tricky parts of getting noticed on search and social media, so established businesses and growing startups can truly focus on what they do best - innovating, building, and serving their customers.
We’re hiring a senior full-stack engineer to help us build AI-powered products end-to-end. You’ll own features from rough idea to production: architecture, implementation, testing, release, and iteration. The work spans modern web (Node.js, React, Next.js, TypeScript) and LLM agents (tooling, function calling, integrations, evaluation, and reliability).
You’ll thrive here if you: (a) write clean, production-grade code fast, (b) treat tests and monitoring as part of “done,” (c) think like a founder—challenge assumptions, propose better paths, make decisions with incomplete data, and ship. We’re an A-player team; we expect proactive ownership, direct communication, and the courage to push back when something isn’t right.
What success looks like:
In first weeks days: ship a user-visible feature, add/extend an agent tool, and land solid PRs with strong tests.
In first Q days: lead a small project across front-end, back-end, and an LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini or Vercel AI SDK/OpenRouter), with metrics and basic evals.
Be a go-to owner for a product slice, raising code quality, performance, and reliability while mentoring others on agent patterns.
Requirements
12+ years professional software engineering experience delivering production systems.
Full-stack depth: Node.js, React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript at an expert level (types as design, not decoration).
AI/LLM agents: hands-on experience building agents with function/tool calling, multi-tool orchestration, retries, cost/latency trade-offs, and safety/guardrails. Comfortable with prompt design, schema design, and deterministic interfaces.
APIs & SDKs: strong with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini; plus nice to have one of Vercel AI SDK or OpenRouter. Able to design clean abstraction layers over external models/tools.
Systems & product thinking: convert fuzzy requirements into simple, resilient architectures. Bias to ship; know when to spike, when to harden.
Testing discipline: writes your own unit, integration, and happy-path/end-to-end tests; partners with QA for edge-cases and complex scenarios. “It works on my machine” is not done.
Quality in production: observability (logs/metrics/traces), feature flags, canary/rollbacks, performance profiling, and error budgets are familiar tools, not buzzwords.
Data & storage: practical experience with REST/GraphQL, Webhooks, background jobs/queues, caching, and at least one SQL database. Comfortable with pagination, idempotency, and rate-limit strategies.
Security & privacy: sound judgment around secrets, authZ/authN, PII handling, and least-privilege by default.
AI-assisted development: enthusiastic and effective using AI for coding/review/testing, while maintaining rigorous standards and architectural sense.
Collaboration: crisp written communication, clear PRs, structured RFCs, and constructive code reviews.
Founder mindset: proactive, decisive, comfortable with uncertainty. Preferred: familiarity with Y Combinator content/principles (default alive, talk to users, build/measure/learn).
Nice to have (not required): RAG pipelines, vector DBs, lightweight eval harnesses, prompt/version management, streaming UX, and cost telemetry.

Pathfinders, a full-service integrated marketing agency, is looking for a Full Stack Developer who can build, connect, and maintain the digital products our clients rely on. At Pathfinders, developers aren’t just coders; they’re problem solvers who turn business goals into reliable, scalable, and high-performing digital experiences.

You’ll also keep existing sites healthy with ongoing maintenance, security updates, and performance tuning. Collaboration is key: you’ll partner with designers, strategists, and account leads to ensure our work not only looks great but also functions seamlessly across systems.

This role is a great fit for someone who enjoys balancing front-end creativity with back-end logic, who gets just as much satisfaction from solving API challenges or database issues as from launching a site that delights clients.
And because we value curiosity, in the final application question, tell us your favorite framework, library, or digital tool (and why). We’re looking for developers who bring ideas and perspective, not just code.

You might be a great fit if you:
Set the Tone: You bring energy and clarity into every conversation. Even when things get tough, you make work feel doable, not draining.
Own the Outcome: You don’t just check boxes. You make sure the work connects to the bigger goal and moves projects forward.
Keep Growing: You stay curious, adapt quickly when things change, and see every challenge as a chance to get better.
We > Me: You believe great work is a team sport. You give credit generously, assume positive intent, and celebrate shared wins.

At Co Author, we’re building an AI-powered platform to make storytelling simple, accessible, and inspiring — even for people who don’t see themselves as “writers.” The mission is big: unlock voices and experiences that too often go unheard.

What You’ll Do
Build and launch the app (iOS/Android or cross-platform).
Own front end (UI/UX) and back end (databases, APIs, integrations).
Prototype, ship, and iterate with speed — “done” beats “perfect.”
Work side by side with founders on product and roadmap.

Founding Engineer,LeftLane Marketing,Remote,remote,2025-10-08,Indeed,"Founding Engineer for Live Commerce Shopify App

What We're Building

A live streaming shopping platform for Shopify merchants. Think QVC meets Instagram Live—merchants broadcast live video while showcasing products, and viewers can buy in real-time during the stream.

This is a greenfield project with a complete PRD. We know exactly what we're building; we need a founding engineer to help build it.

What Makes This a Founding Role
You'll work directly with the CTO, building this from the ground up
Your architectural input will shape the product
Real ownership over features and technical decisions
Opportunity to grow with the company as we scale
Well-compensated with room for rate increases as we prove out the model

Working Style We Need
Ship fast, iterate often - We want working features weekly, not perfect code monthly
AI-forward - You use AI tools to move faster, handle boilerplate, and explore solutions quickly
Collaborative - You're comfortable with pair programming, code reviews, and technical discussions
Independent - You can own features end-to-end without constant direction
Pragmatic - You know when to build custom vs. use a library, when to optimize vs. ship

What You Won't Be Doing
Designing the product (PRD is complete)
DevOps complexity (Railway handles deployments)
Fighting with Docker locally (we don't use it)
Working in isolation (you'll collaborate daily with the CTO)

Ideal Candidate
You've built a Shopify app before, and it wasn't your first rodeo with real-time features. You're comfortable owning significant parts of the codebase but also enjoy collaborating with another technical co-founder. You use AI tools heavily but know when to override them. You've shipped products that real users depend on.

You might be a senior IC looking for a well-paid founding opportunity, a technical founder between projects, or an experienced developer ready to help build something from zero to one.

Project Scope
Timeline: 8-24 weeks to MVP, with potential for long-term engagement
Commitment: Full-time (40+ hours/week) - we're moving fast
Location: Fully remote, any timezone
Compensation: Competitive hourly rate for senior-level talent
Team: You'll work directly with the CTO

To Apply
Send us:
Portfolio/GitHub - Show us Shopify apps or real-time features you've built
Your AI workflow - What tools do you use and how?
One question - What's your first question about the technical approach?
Rate & timing - What you charge and when you can start

No cover letters, no fluff. Just show us you can do the work.
Compensation:
$25 - $50 hourly
Responsibilities:
What You'll Be Building
A merchant dashboard to control live streams (switch products, monitor sales, moderate chat)
A customer-facing stream viewer page (watch live video, see featured products, participate in chat)
Real-time features connecting everything together (product updates, live chat, viewer counts)
The full stream lifecycle (setup go live end stream
analytics)

What You Won't Be Doing
Designing the product (PRD is complete)
DevOps complexity (Railway handles deployments)
Fighting with Docker locally (we don't use it)
Working in isolation (you'll collaborate daily with the CTO)

The Stack
Frontend: Remix (React Router 7)
Backend: Node.js with real-time WebSockets
Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
Video: Mux streaming
Hosting: Railway
Platform: Shopify embedded app
Qualifications:
Strong React/TypeScript skills - This is a modern React app with complex state management
Real-time/WebSocket experience - You've built chat apps, collaborative tools, or live dashboards before
High-volume application experience - You've built apps handling thousands of concurrent users with real-time updates
Shopify app development - You've built at least one Shopify embedded app and understand their ecosystem
PostgreSQL comfort - You can design schemas and write efficient queries
AI-assisted development - You're a power user of Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or similar tools

Node TS + React TS + LLM Agents | Full Stack Developer,S.A.G.A Corp,Remote,remote,2025-10-08,Indeed,"You're built for big things, not endless marketing tasks. At SAAGA Solve, our intelligent agents manage all the tricky parts of getting noticed on search and social media, so established businesses and growing startups can truly focus on what they do best - innovating, building, and serving their customers.
We’re hiring a senior full-stack engineer to help us build AI-powered products end-to-end. You’ll own features from rough idea to production: architecture, implementation, testing, release, and iteration. The work spans modern web (Node.js, React, Next.js, TypeScript) and LLM agents (tooling, function calling, integrations, evaluation, and reliability).
You’ll thrive here if you: (a) write clean, production-grade code fast, (b) treat tests and monitoring as part of “done,” (c) think like a founder—challenge assumptions, propose better paths, make decisions with incomplete data, and ship. We’re an A-player team; we expect proactive ownership, direct communication, and the courage to push back when something isn’t right.
What success looks like:
In first weeks days: ship a user-visible feature, add/extend an agent tool, and land solid PRs with strong tests.
In first Q days: lead a small project across front-end, back-end, and an LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini or Vercel AI SDK/OpenRouter), with metrics and basic evals.
Be a go-to owner for a product slice, raising code quality, performance, and reliability while mentoring others on agent patterns.
Requirements
12+ years professional software engineering experience delivering production systems.
Full-stack depth: Node.js, React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript at an expert level (types as design, not decoration).
AI/LLM agents: hands-on experience building agents with function/tool calling, multi-tool orchestration, retries, cost/latency trade-offs, and safety/guardrails. Comfortable with prompt design, schema design, and deterministic interfaces.
APIs & SDKs: strong with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini; plus nice to have one of Vercel AI SDK or OpenRouter. Able to design clean abstraction layers over external models/tools.
Systems & product thinking: convert fuzzy requirements into simple, resilient architectures. Bias to ship; know when to spike, when to harden.
Testing discipline: writes your own unit, integration, and happy-path/end-to-end tests; partners with QA for edge-cases and complex scenarios. “It works on my machine” is not done.
Quality in production: observability (logs/metrics/traces), feature flags, canary/rollbacks, performance profiling, and error budgets are familiar tools, not buzzwords.
Data & storage: practical experience with REST/GraphQL, Webhooks, background jobs/queues, caching, and at least one SQL database. Comfortable with pagination, idempotency, and rate-limit strategies.
Security & privacy: sound judgment around secrets, authZ/authN, PII handling, and least-privilege by default.
AI-assisted development: enthusiastic and effective using AI for coding/review/testing, while maintaining rigorous standards and architectural sense.
Collaboration: crisp written communication, clear PRs, structured RFCs, and constructive code reviews.
Founder mindset: proactive, decisive, comfortable with uncertainty. Preferred: familiarity with Y Combinator content/principles (default alive, talk to users, build/measure/learn).
Nice to have (not required): RAG pipelines, vector DBs, lightweight eval harnesses, prompt/version management, streaming UX, and cost telemetry.

Node TS + React TS + LLM Agents | Full Stack Developer,S.A.G.A Corp,Remote,remote,2025-10-08,Indeed,"You're built for big things, not endless marketing tasks. At SAAGA Solve, our intelligent agents manage all the tricky parts of getting noticed on search and social media, so established businesses and growing startups can truly focus on what they do best - innovating, building, and serving their customers.
We’re hiring a senior full-stack engineer to help us build AI-powered products end-to-end. You’ll own features from rough idea to production: architecture, implementation, testing, release, and iteration. The work spans modern web (Node.js, React, Next.js, TypeScript) and LLM agents (tooling, function calling, integrations, evaluation, and reliability).
You’ll thrive here if you: (a) write clean, production-grade code fast, (b) treat tests and monitoring as part of “done,” (c) think like a founder—challenge assumptions, propose better paths, make decisions with incomplete data, and ship. We’re an A-player team; we expect proactive ownership, direct communication, and the courage to push back when something isn’t right.
What success looks like:
In first weeks days: ship a user-visible feature, add/extend an agent tool, and land solid PRs with strong tests.
In first Q days: lead a small project across front-end, back-end, and an LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini or Vercel AI SDK/OpenRouter), with metrics and basic evals.
Be a go-to owner for a product slice, raising code quality, performance, and reliability while mentoring others on agent patterns.
Requirements
12+ years professional software engineering experience delivering production systems.
Full-stack depth: Node.js, React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript at an expert level (types as design, not decoration).
AI/LLM agents: hands-on experience building agents with function/tool calling, multi-tool orchestration, retries, cost/latency trade-offs, and safety/guardrails. Comfortable with prompt design, schema design, and deterministic interfaces.
APIs & SDKs: strong with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini; plus nice to have one of Vercel AI SDK or OpenRouter. Able to design clean abstraction layers over external models/tools.
Systems & product thinking: convert fuzzy requirements into simple, resilient architectures. Bias to ship; know when to spike, when to harden.
Testing discipline: writes your own unit, integration, and happy-path/end-to-end tests; partners with QA for edge-cases and complex scenarios. “It works on my machine” is not done.
Quality in production: observability (logs/metrics/traces), feature flags, canary/rollbacks, performance profiling, and error budgets are familiar tools, not buzzwords.
Data & storage: practical experience with REST/GraphQL, Webhooks, background jobs/queues, caching, and at least one SQL database. Comfortable with pagination, idempotency, and rate-limit strategies.
Security & privacy: sound judgment around secrets, authZ/authN, PII handling, and least-privilege by default.
AI-assisted development: enthusiastic and effective using AI for coding/review/testing, while maintaining rigorous standards and architectural sense.
Collaboration: crisp written communication, clear PRs, structured RFCs, and constructive code reviews.
Founder mindset: proactive, decisive, comfortable with uncertainty. Preferred: familiarity with Y Combinator content/principles (default alive, talk to users, build/measure/learn).
Nice to have (not required): RAG pipelines, vector DBs, lightweight eval harnesses, prompt/version management, streaming UX, and cost telemetry.
